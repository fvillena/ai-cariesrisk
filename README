# Performance of Large Language Models on CariesCare Risk Stratification

This repository contains the code used in the study **“Performance of Large Language Models on CariesCare Risk Stratification.”** It includes all scripts required to reproduce the model predictions and the subsequent statistical analyses.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main notebooks:

1. **Model Predictions (Python)**
   - Generates predictions from the evaluated large language models.
   - Includes data preprocessing, prompt construction, and model inference.
   - Implemented in Python.

2. **Results Analysis (R)**
   - Performs statistical analysis of the model outputs.
   - Computes performance metrics and generates figures.
   - Implemented in R.

## Data

The dataset used in this study is publicly available on Zenodo:

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18759669

Please download the dataset from Zenodo and place it in the appropriate directory as described in the notebooks before running the analyses.


## Requirements

- **Python** (for model prediction notebook)  
  Recommended: Python 3.12+  
  Required packages are listed in the corresponding notebook.

- **R** (for analysis notebook)  
  Required libraries are listed at the beginning of the R notebook.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the results:

1. Run the Python notebook to generate model predictions.
2. Run the R notebook to perform the statistical analysis and generate the reported results.
